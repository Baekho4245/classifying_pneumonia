    "Aim for a Proof of Concept\n",
    "With Deep Learning, data is king -- the more of it, the better. However, the goal of this project isn't to build the best model possible -- it's to demonstrate your understanding by building a model that works. You should try to avoid datasets and model architectures that won't run in reasonable time on your own machine. For many problems, this means downsampling your dataset and only training on a portion of it. Once you're absolutely sure that you've found the best possible architecture and other hyperparameters for your model, then consider training your model on your entire dataset overnight (or, as larger portion of the dataset that will still run in a feasible amount of time).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, we want to see your thought process as you iterate and improve on a model. A project that achieves a lower level of accuracy but has clearly iterated on the model and the problem until it found the best possible approach is more impressive than a model with high accuracy that did no iteration. We're not just interested in seeing you finish a model -- we want to see that you understand it, and can use this knowledge to try and make it even better!\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation\n",
    "Evaluation is fairly straightforward for this project. But you'll still need to think about which metric to use and about how best to cross-validate your results."
